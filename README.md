> A curated list of awesome resources for Robotics Engineers and hobbyists

![Robotics Engineer](https://github.com/athivvat/awesome-robotics/blob/main/robotics-engineer.jpg)

A robotics engineer designs, builds, tests, and programs robots and automated systems for industries like manufacturing, aerospace, defense, and healthcare. Combining principles from mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, they create, maintain, and improve machines—such as robotic arms or autonomous systems—to perform precise, repetitive, or dangerous tasks. 

The core challenge: building end-to-end systems that work in the real world.

Robotics isn't a single skill—it's a stack. An interdisciplinary field combining **math + physics + software + hardware**, all unified through control systems.
